# CaesarCipher
Encryption/Decryption

A CLI based Application that runs on JAVA that can be used for Ceaser Cipher Encryption/Decryption

## What is Caesar Cipher?
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

## Known Issues(Bugs to Be Fixed)

1.Shifts(Encrypts/Decrypts) spaces (should add new feature in later updates).

## Note!
Will switch to a swing based GUI interface in the future.
